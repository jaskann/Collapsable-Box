# Collapsable-Box

Jasmine Kan

Project Summary: 
This box is designed for children who have difficulty in finishing their meals within a certain amount of time. As the amount of time that the box will remain held up can be programmed using the Arduino, it is not only fun for children, but can also challenge them to finish eating before their food spills all over them. Through this product, it can help resolve various headaches that parents face, and create more entertaintment and discipline for children during mealtimes.

Bill of Materials:
1. 1 Arduino Uno
2. 1 9V Battery
3. 1 9V Battery Snap
4. 1 Stranded jumper wires (black)
5. 1 Stranded jumper wires (red)
6. 1 Stranded jumper wires (yellow)
7. 1 Small DC Motor
8. 1 On/Off Switch

Directions:
1. Plug the yellow jump wire into the yellow section on the DC Motor
2. Plug the red jump wire into red section on the DC Motor
3. Plug the black jump wire into black section on the DC Motor
4. Connect the other end of the yellow jump wire to Pin 9 on the Arduino Uno
5. Connect the other end of the red jump wire to 5V on the Arduino Uno
6. Connect the other end of the black jump wire to GND on the Arduino Uno
7. Using the USB cable, upload the code from the computer onto the Arduino Uno
8. Test the code (if works, unplug the USB cable)
9. Determine the positive and negative ends of the On/Off switch
10. Cut the red wire of the 9V Battery Snap into two 
11. Determine the positive and negative ends of the red wire and connect it accordingly to the On/Off switch (positive with positive & negative with negative)
12. Plug the 9V Battery Snap into the Arduino Uno and power it by connecting the 9V Battery to the snap on the other side
